# (WIP) AI is changing programming

Programming as a profession is going into the next phase like the how we gone through punch cards, assembly, and C.
For now AI is really good auto complete, but programming as we know it will not remain the same even after this AI hype is over.


If we model programming as running a simple function of ```f(x) = m * x^z```
other programming tools only really update the coefficient m where as AI update the degree variable z. 

AI is really changing what programming task means, since it will change both the physical and mental part of the job. Physically we will do less typing and type different things (likely not code). Mentally we will focus and think on a different model than before.

Some examples of how AI helped me. This website is created with cursor + claude 3.5 sonnet. The part around the dark mode switch on this website was done by AI. 

Before AI if I wanted to have a dark mode switch I would have went looking for examples online and copy. I would have already known its possible and have a basic guess on how it would work. At the core its js changing css, or here its updating a react state for my components. 

With AI I can avoid the blank canvas and instruct AI to give me something that is working. I then iterate on it to fit my needs. Working with AI really makes you think clearly about the requirements. Before I would have a high level goals and just start trying things out in code. Working with AI more I would narrow down the tasks to something AI can accomplish and this in turn help me understand what the real requirements are.
